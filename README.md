## 2024 Update

**This project needs funding.** We are currently supporting the domain registration from our own money but as money gets tighter it becomes more of a struggle to keep this project running. Check back here for more updates regarding this issue. 

- In the near future, we are looking at creating a fresh new website to support this project. This website will feature a clean modern design with up to date information.
- Domain purging will happen towards the end of this year in order to allow new people to get the subdomain they want. To stop your domain from being purged, make sure that you are using the domain. If yours does get purged and you would like it back, you will need to re-register the domain.

## Register
Please read the [documentation](https://docs.is-a-good.dev) to register a new domain manually.

Or if you want to register a domain using your command line, you can check out our [CLI](https://github.com/is-a-good-dev/cli).

Your pull request **will not** be merged if:
- You already own a subdomain on our service.
- The records provided includes invalid/unpermitted record types. If this happens we will notify you and request changes.
- It violates users privacy.
- It uses Vercel or Netlify, as there are issues with subdomain verification. We hope to add support back soon.

*If your subdomain is inactive, it may be purged. We will try and notify you before purging via the email you provided.*
